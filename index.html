          There is a fairly universal stereotype about programmers: we are reclusive introverts wanting to interface
          solely with our multiple computer monitors, preferably in a darkened room. We leave our battle
          station/fortress of solitude/code dojo only when driven forth by a biological need to eat, sleep or use the
          bathroom. We never speak to others unless (a) absolutely necessary or (b) as our online RPG avatar self
          (irresistibly well-endowed high-level mage/warrior). As with all stereotypes, this is somewhat rooted in
          reality. As programmers, our passions drive us to interact with machines more, and perhaps more able, than
          with other humans.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, life as a software developer is much more social and collaborative than the stereotypes would have
          non-coders believe — at times, even frustratingly so. Thankfully, there is git: version control software to
          bring
          collaboration with project team members right back where it belongs: on the command line.
        </p>
        <p>This “Git for Dummies”-styled tutorial is for non-programmer people who need to be able to collaborate and
          communicate effectively, with coders. We will start with the super basics of what git even is, why we use it,
          and how
          to get started. By the end of this tutorial, you should be able to approach a coder in their natural habitat!

        <h1 class="section__title">What is Git?</h1>
        <p>Git is version-control software for working on group project collaboration. Not collaboration as in group
          dynamics and
          fair distribution of project workloads and who ate the last jelly doughnut, but in the actual mechanics of
          sharing work
          back and forth. When a week's worth of shared project progress gets accidentally deleted or overwritten, or
          hours of
          work get eaten by a faulty file transfer, things can get, well, angry.</p>
        <p>
          Just as Google Drive makes it possible for multiple contributors to write, edit and add to the contents of a
          single text
          file, git is a computer program making it possible for multiple coders (and project managers, testers, content
          providers, and whomever else is on the team) to collaborate on a single project.
        </p>
        <p>
          Learning git can be intimidating if you yourself have little or no programming experience, but just keep
          thinking of it
          as a funny-looking Google Docs and you'll do fine! Fun fact: git was invented by Linus Torvalds — the same
          Linus who
          created the Linux open-source operating system which now runs vast swaths of the internet, including Google
          and
          Facebook.
        </p>
        <p>So: git is a piece of software that you install on your computer, which then handles version control for you.
          What,
          then, is version control?
        </p>
      </article>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="What_is_Version_Control?">
      <article class="section__article">
        <h1 class="section__title">What is Version Control?</h1>
        <p>
          Imagine you have a brand new project. Naturally, you plan to store all related files in a single new
          directory. As work
          progresses, these files will change. A lot. Things will get disorganized, even messy, and at some point even
          completely
          fubar. At that point, you would want to go back in time to the most recent not-messy, still-working version of
          your
          project — if only that were possible!
        </p>

        <p>
          Well, thanks to git, it is. Version control happens when you install git on your computer. Git is built to
          create that
          new project directory, and to keep track of all the changes you make to any and all files you put in that
          directory. As
          things progress and you make additions and changes, git takes a “snapshot” of the current version. And that,
          friends, is
          version control: make a small change, take a snapshot, make another small change, take a snapshot…And save all
          of these
          snapshots in chronological order. You can then use git to step back and forth as necessary through each
          version of your
          project directory.
        </p>
        <p>
          So when you screw up, git is like having this magic ability to go back in time to the last good version before
          you
          gaffed. Thus, version control. git is not the only version control systems out there, but it is probably the
          most widely
          used. It is also essential for using GitHub, which is the most popular public website and platform for hosting
          and
          sharing projects. It's not the same as git — it's a hub for projects that use git version control.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will discuss GitHub here only briefly because first it's important to understand what git itself does.
          Using GitHub
          itself, however, is a whole other learning curve, which we will learn in our next tutorial.

        <h1 class="section__title">Collaborating with Git</h1>
        <p>
          Easy enough to understand as one person working solo on one project. But envision working with a whole team of
          people
          where you all need to share the same project directory. You will make changes to your part of the project —
          while
          working locally on your laptop — and your collaborators will be doing the same on their portions of the
          project on their
          own machines. How do you share changes to your collaborators, and also have the changes they make appear in
          your own
          local working version? How do you make sure something you are working on doesn't conflict or crash things
          other people
          are working on?
        </p>
        <p>
          Git is a distributed version control system. This means that git has commands that allow you to “push” your
          changes to
          other people's machines, and “pull” their changes to yours. Meanwhile, GitHub holds onto a master version —
          actually, a
          master library of all the versions, ever — of the project to keep things from getting too wild and crazy.
        </p>
        <p>It also allows everyone to push and pull changes from a central repository, so in case one of your coworkers
          is out sick
          for a week things don't get hung up when you can't access their portion of the project because their laptop is
          home with
          them in Flu Central. Again, more about this next time in “Getting Started with GitHub.”</p>

    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Getting_git">
      <article class="section__article">
        <h1 class="section__title">Getting git</h1>
        <h2>Step 1. Download git</h2>
        <p>
          Choose the right one for your own preferred operating system: Mac OS, Linux or Windows. It will self-install.
          Don't
          worry if it looks like nothing's happening.
        </p>

        <h2>Step 2. Open Terminal</h2>
        <p>
          I'm sorry but you're just going to have to use the command line. So, shut up and shell: Linux users, you
          already
          know
          what to do. For Mac users, it's Finder -> Applications -> Utilities -> Terminal. Windows users (why are you
          even
          here?),
          you're going to have to download and install a terminal emulator.
        </p>

        <p>
          If this step has you frozen in terror because you have absolutely no idea what to do now, or how to do it, go
          directly
          to the amazing Command Line Crash Course and work through that (takes a couple hours and will leave you
          feeling
          like a
          code commando, I promise!).
        </p>

        <h2>Step 3. Tell git you exist</h2>
        <p>
          Now it is time to configure your name and email. Do this by typing in the following, of course replacing the
          values with
          your own name and email.
        </p>

        <code>git config --global user.name 'My_Name'
            git config --global user.email 'myEmail@wherever.com'
            git config --global color.ui 'auto'
          </code>

        <p>
          That last line is optional; it tells git to automatically make any output of git commands in the terminal
          nicely color coded, which is much easier to and also to understand. The reason we put “-global” in front of
          each is to avoid typing these config commands the next time we start a git project on our system. So this way,
          git knows who you are — forever.
        </p>

        <h2>Step 4. Create a new directory</h2>
        <p>
          Now it's time to practice setting up a sample project. Set yourself up an empty directory to hold all your
          glorious,
          soon-to-exist project files hint: $mkdir (yourDirectoryNameHere). Then CD into it and type the magic words
          “git
          init”:
        </p>

        <p>
          “Git init” creates a new git Repository, usually called a “repo.” Envision it as your project's folder, only
          now with git superpowers. A repository contains all of your project files as well as extra, mostly invisible
          stuff that git generates to track store each file's revision history.
        </p>

      </article>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Get_Into_the_Git_Workflow">
      <article class="section__article">
        <h1 class="section__title">Get Into the Git Workflow</h1>
        <p>
          At this point you have created a repository on your own computer. The extra stuff git put in there consists of
          three
          separate “trees” — don't worry, these are entirely managed and maintained by git. The main area you engage
          with is the
          Working Directory, which contains your actual project files. There is also the Index, a kind of temporary
          holding area
          for your newest changes and additions. And the Head which points to the last Commit — the most recent saved
          version.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pro tip: every time you type a git command into the terminal, it must begin with “git”: the format is
          generally “git do
          whatever.” This tells your computer that you specifically want to activate git, as opposed to other terminal
          options
          that are available.
        </p>
        <h2>Step 5. Add a “README” file and project files</h2>
        <p>
          It's an excellent idea to start by creating a “README” file to explain what your project is, what might be
          found within,
          etc. (A project README doesn't need to be encyclopedic — just the basic facts, ma'am. It doesn't get written
          at this
          time, either — we are just setting up the directory right now). This, by the way, is a basic command line
          endeavor, not
          git specific: “touch README.md”:
        </p>
        <code class="code">git-for-dummies[michellegienow]->touch README.md
          git-for-dummies[michellegienow]->ls README.md
        </code>
        <p>
          Since you are the one who knows your project parameters, you're in charge of adding the actual project files.
          Just
          repeat the process above using the appropriate file names.
        </p>
        <h2>Step 6. Copy your repository
        </h2>
        <p>In this step we create a working copy of your local repository — your current project — so you can mess
          around in it without consequences.</p>
        <p>
          It is crucial to work from a copy, particularly in a group collaboration! If your work goes well, you save
          everything as
          you go (that will be our next step). Ultimately, all the changes/additions you just made get added back to the
          original
          repository, and that becomes the current version. Meanwhile, other people are doing the same thing in their
          own copied
          versions, which quickly become different from your copied version.
        </p>

        <p>
          The beauty of git is that it keeps track of all this stuff for you — who has changed what where — and
          orchestrates it
          all.
        </p>
        <p>
          So copy — or clone, in git-speak — your repo by running the command “$git clone /path/to/your_repository:”
        </p>
        <code class="code">git-for-dummies[michellegienow]->git clone /Users/michell/git-for-dummies/
          Cloning into 'git-for-dummies'...
          warning: You appear to have cloned an empty repository.
          done

          git-for-dummies[michellegienow]->ls README.md
          git-for dummies
        </code>
        <p>
          (If you are starting by copying a file somebody else has already started, taking it from whatever
          remote/server, your
          command will be “$git clone username@host:/path/to/repository”).
        </p>

        <p>
          Notice how inside our original git-for-dummies directory we now have a new, copy directory of git-for-dummies
          (next to
          our README). The reason it's telling us we appear to have copied an empty repository is because we have not
          yet saved
          our new additions (staged our commits).
        </p>
        <h2>Step 7. Check status</h2>
        <p>
          (BTW behind the scenes I added a placeholder file called “my_file.md” so we have something in our repo besides
          the readme). Now that we have some files in our repository, let us see how git treats them. To check the
          current
          status of your repository, type “git status”:
        </p>
        <code class="code">git-for-dummies[michellegienow]->git status
          On branch master

          Initial Commit
          Untracked files:
            (use "git add &lt;file>..." to include in what will be committed)
          <p class="code__text--danger">README.md
            my_file.md</p>
          nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

          git-for-dummies[michellegienow]->|
        </code>

        <h2>Step 8. Tell git to add your changes</h2>
        <p>
          Git status is telling us that we have new files that have not been officially added to the git tracking
          process. To tell
          git that, yes, please be the sweet sweet concierge of these files, we add them to git. Confusingly, this is
          called
          “staging” them when the command is actually “git add (file name here)”:
        </p>
        <code class="code">git-for-dummies[michellegienow]->git add README.md
          git-for-dummies[michellegienow]->git my_file.md
          git-for-dummies[michellegienow]->git add *
          git-for-dummies[michellegienow]->git status
          On branch master

          Initial Commit
          Changes to be committed:
          (use "git rm --cached &lt;file>..." to unstage)
                <p class="code__text--success">new file: READMED.md</p>
        </code>

        <p>
          Notice how the text color has changed from red to green: you have made git happy! Once you have staged your
          files, using
          “git add,” you can commit them into git.
        </p>

        <h2>Step 9 git commit!</h2>
        <p>
          Again, imagine each commit as a snapshot of a point in time where you can return, if necessary, to access your
          repository in its earlier state.</p>

        <p>
          To identify each of these snapshots, you provide a commit message. This is a brief statement of what exactly
          happened in
          between the last version and this, the latest and greatest. Provide a useful commit message because it helps
          you in
          identifying what you changed in that commit — this is the only place where viewers can see not just what has
          changed,
          but why. So it's worth putting a bit of thought into each commit message — try thinking about what future you
          would want
          to know about the stuff you just added or changed. This is a terrific article about writing useful commit
          messages; read
          it, do the things, and future you will thank you.
        </p>
        <p>
          That said, your very first commit message when establishing a new repository is always “Initial commit.” A
          commit
          message is formatted 'git commit -m "my commit message"':
        </p>
        <code class="code">git-for-dummies[michellefienow]->git commit -m "Initial commit"
        [master (root-commit) a4105ea] Inital Commit
          2 files changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
          create mode 100644 README.md
          create mode 100644 my_file.md

        git-for-dummies[michellegienow]->git status
        On branch master
        Your branch is based on 'origin/master', bur the upstream is gone.
        (use "git branch --unset-upstream" to fixup)
        nothing to commit, working tree clean
        </code>

        <p>
          Git identifies each unique commit by attaching a long hexadecimal number to every commit. In the screenshot,
          notice that
          “a4105ea” our first commit. This is like the caption on your snapshot. Should we need to go back in time and
          access this
          particular version of our project, this is the “name” you would use to identify the version you want.
        </p>

        <h2>Step 10. There is no Step 10 because YOU DID IT!!!! ???</h2>
        <p>
          Notice how in the screenshot above, following the commit we did a “git status”. git returned the lovely
          message “Nothing
          to commit, working tree clean” (remember our trees? If not, go back and re-read the git Workflow section,
          above). This
          means you are all caught up and current. That git has captured and saved a snapshot of your project. Though
          this early
          on, it's kind of like a baby picture.</p>

        <p>
          However, as your project changes and grows, you will be capturing loads of snapshots to document the journey.
          Meaning:
          commit often. So you can literally turn back time to your project's earlier, more innocent days… ah, if only
          there were
          a human version…
        </p>

        <p>Ahem. Ok, yeah, so, Git's got your back…at least on your own computer right now.</p>
        <p>
          Next time: we take our repo on the road and learn how to put it up on GitHub so others can play, too!</p>
